           An engaging web design for small to large businesses

        <p id="header-el">
            Having a well-functioning website is an important part for running a successful business.
            However, it can be hard to know what makes an engaging web design. <br><br>

            That is why you need a person like me, who knows how to build a website that
            is appealing and engaging to your visitors.

                Growing up in South Africa, in Eastern Cape, l was a kid with no sense of direction of what l wanted
                to become in life. l attended school every day and l would watch other kids
                 talk about their dreams of becoming doctors, pharmacists, scientists, and engineers. <br><br> 

                These fields were in demand and if one would land a job in one of them,
                that person would live a decent lifestyle, and that was our definition of "success".
                However, l always had this deep ambition that had no outlet. <br><br>
                
                I wanted to find something that would help me express myself,
                but l did not know where to find that or how. At this point l was in high school,
                pursuing a career of becoming a civil engineer, eventhough l did not like it.
                I took rap music as a hobby. I started with no instrumentals,
                the only thing l had was a pen, paper, and my voice. As l kept practising how to rap,
                l began liking it more, until I bought myself a laptop and a microphone,
                each step I took was more and more exciting. <br><br>
                
                I had a dream of releasing my music to all music platforms.
                To do that I needed to find people who would enhance the quality of my music.
                After l passed my last grade in high school, l went to a college called
                African Film Drama Art(AFDA), in Cape Town. In that college everyone was creative,
                some students wanted to become film makers, some wanted to become musicians,
                 and some wanted to become business entrepreneurs. <br><br>
                
                One of my lectures, hooked me up with people who would enhance
                the quality of the sound of my music and release it to all music platforms. <br><br>
                
                Music has a creative side and a business side.
                Since l wanted my music to be recognised, I needed to know the business side of it.
                In college I chose to become a business entrepreneur, not only for my music,
                but also to learn how to be independent(to not depend only on my degree to get a job). <br><br>
                
                In AFDA l was taught the fundamentals of UI/UX design.
                I instantly fell in love with the aesthetic elements of web design.
                When my music was released to all streaming services,
                l started fantasising about having my own website for my music,
                where people could have access to my lyrics and a description of each song. <br><br>
                
                I created the design of my website through Figma, and l made it to be interactive
                as if it was an actual website. But my mind still wanted more,
                it said if my website was on Google, everyone would have an access to it,
                even people l do not know. I figured that there are lot of things
                l would do if l would have skills of creating an actual website. <br><br>
                
                I taught myself how to code, l learnt HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                I was fascinated by this new world l was in, l practiced day and night,
                until l was ready to turn my website design into an actual website.
                While l was still working on my next project for my music, my mind still
                wanted me to create more websites, and find independency by becoming a freelancer,
                just like I always wanted. <br><br>
                
                Now here am I, at my creative peak.
                Utilising every tool that is in my disposal and making the most out of it.
                Expanding my skill base and my possibilities in the the process of self discovery,
                combining these skills in ways that are unique and suited to my individuality.
