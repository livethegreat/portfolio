                <p id="header-el">Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include
                a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
                preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. <br><br>

                At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT
                signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser 
                signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
                 If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
                we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p> <br><br>

                by an updated 'Revised' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
                If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently
